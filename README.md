# HEAT-EXCHANGER-DESIGN
The project's primary objective is to observe and analyze the simultaneous dynamic and spacial change of temperature within a heat exchanger, thus enabling a holistic understanding of its thermal behaviour. Additionally, the project endeavours to meticulously evaluate the design aspects of various heat exchanger configurations, such as shell and tube as well as double pipe heat exchangers.

1.**Design of Double Pipe Heat Exchanger**
    The main focus is to analyse and model the simultaneous dynamic and spacial change of temperature in both **_CO-CURRENT & COUNTER CURRENT DOUBLE PIPE HEAT EXCHANGER_**.
    The plotted data shows the change of temperature along the length of the exchanger as well as the time effect also adjusted simultaneously.
    
2.**DESIGN OF SHELL AND TUBE HEAT EXCHANGER**
    The primary objective of this endeavour is to intricately model and solve the partial differential equation governing the 3-D temperature distribution over time and along the length of the heat exchanger,           encompassing both the tube and shell sides. Additionally, crucial design parameters such as **tube count, total heat demand, LMTD Corrected temperature, and requisite surface area** are meticulously computed,       offering a comprehensive insight into the heat exchanger's performance and design considerations.
